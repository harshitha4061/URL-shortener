Authentication:
two types:
1)statefull:it store state or data on server
2)stateless:it does not have state

client-------->server (email,password)
client<--------server(uid)(session id)

it can pass uid in header,response,cookies(in REST API we pass through header)

client------->server(request server with uid)
server(checks the uid and its permission and send response)

client--->auth middleware which checks uid(next())----->functional code
