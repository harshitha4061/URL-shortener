Authentication:
two types:
1)statefull:it store state or data on server
2)stateless:it does not have state

client-------->server (email,password)
client<--------server(uid)(session id)

it can pass uid in header,response,cookies(in REST API we pass through header)

client------->server(request server with uid)
server(checks the uid and its permission and send response)

client--->auth middleware which checks uid(next())----->functional code

in statefull we have to store data on server,server has limited memory
so we came up with stateless

in stateless we use jwt:header,encoding patterns ,data--->it creates some encrypted text
when you give it to ,it automatically decodes it to orginal data ,so no need to store the state on server rather it is stored near client

in banks we need it for short time so we use sessions
for other pplication which has longer time we use tokens
